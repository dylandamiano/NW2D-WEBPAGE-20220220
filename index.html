                                            There is currently nothing to display on this page.

                                            Well, while you're here, let me give you a brief history lesson on
                                            the "Naval Warfare 2D" project.
                                            <br/>
                                            Of course, since you're not the developer, you're going to want to
                                            know more about why I decided to make the game, what I put into it,
                                            and so on so-forth.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            I originally got the idea to develop Naval Warfare 2D back
                                            in December of 2021. At the time, I have not really
                                            make a game but rather just tinkered with the Python programming
                                            language because I could. In addition with this, I also decided
                                            to poke around with a few other languages like LUA, C++, Java, and
                                            Javascript. However, I haven't really did much with them besides
                                            just learning about how it functions, what it can be used for, you
                                            sort of get the point.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            When I was starting to think of this game, I decided to opt for Python
                                            because I knew it well. However, I did not know of any game engine
                                            or game framework that could make my project come to light. Instead,
                                            I took it to Reddit and of course, the Reddit community always comes
                                            in with the clutch. Thus, I decided to float (no pun intended) with
                                            Pygame for the time being.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            As time went on, I figured out that Pygame was an easy-to-use framework
                                            that is friendly to developers of all levels. In addition to this,
                                            you can sort of 'reinvent the wheel' per-sae rather than using something
                                            like a game engine where most of the calculations for physics, collisions,
                                            and many other things may already be done for you thus saving you the hastle
                                            of having to recreate it. And this is why I chose to stick with it.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            I have an intention when it comes to recreating this game in the
                                            future as I can do better than what I did as of this moment.
                                            <br/><br/>
